# Fantasy-Pygame-8-Bits
This repository was created in order to show you a video game made using Pygame
## Autor: **Danny Ch√°vez**<br>

## How we built it

## Different elements were used to create the video game:

It has a background image that helps give the game an atmosphere.
It has a start menu that is made up of two buttons: the first button is to load the game and the second button is to quit the game immediately.
```
#Creating Buttons for the Main Menu
start_button = Button(screen_width // 2 - 350, screen_height // 2, start_img)
exit_button = Button(screen_width // 2 + 350, screen_height // 2, exit_img)
```
Different images were selected to build the scene. Among these, we can mention: platforms, coins, thorns, buttons, and gravity.
The game also has sounds such as the start of the game, when the character walks, when the magician takes a coin, jumping sound every time the user presses the space bar on the keyboard to move the character around the game area.
It has collisions between the enemy objects and the main character, if there is a collision then it's game over. Appearing to the player a message and a reset button.

Regarding the technical aspects of video programming, we have the following:

The installation of **pygame** was done on the work computer. 
It was verified that there was a version of **python** installed on the computer.
**Visual Studio Code** was used for programming.

## Once the main file of the video game was created, the following was done

Import the necessary libraries to work with Pygame

```
import pygame
import sys
import os
from pygame.locals import *
from pygame import mixer
```
Define the dimension of the window in WIDTH and HEIGHT that will be used to present the video game. In this case, the dimension used is 1800 x 1000
```
screen_width = 1800
screen_height = 1000
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Fantasy Pygame 8 Bits")
```
4 global variables were declared to be used to control operations within the source code.
```
tile_size = 50
game_over = 0
main_menu = True
score = 0
```
In order to know where to place the elements that will be part of the game area, a special function was created that draws a grid taking into account the dimensions of the window.
```
def draw_grid():
    for line in range(0, 40):
        pygame.draw.line(screen, (255, 255, 255), (0, line * tile_size), (screen_width, line * tile_size))
        pygame.draw.line(screen, (255, 255, 255), (line * tile_size, 0), (line * tile_size, screen_height))
```
The control of the character of the video game is done by means of the keyboard. In this case, to control its movement, use the directional keys --> to go to the right and <-- to go to the left. With the spacebar, you control the jump of the character. If the player presses the space bar several times in a row then continuous jumps are generated providing a kind of gravity or the character can fly on the Y axis of the window. And by doing the combination of the directional keys plus the space bar then you can reach the coins that are in different positions in the player window.
```
if game_over == 0:
            #When the user get keypresses
            key = pygame.key.get_pressed()
            if key[pygame.K_SPACE] and self.jumped == False:
                jump_fx.play()
                self.vel_y = -15
                self.jumped = True
            if key[pygame.K_SPACE] == False:
                self.jumped = False
            if key[pygame.K_LEFT]:
                dx -= 3 #If we increase the number, the sprite will move "more fast"
                self.counter += 1
                self.direction = -1
            if key[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
                dx += 3 #If we increase the number, the sprite will move "more fast"
                self.counter += 1
                self.direction = 1
            if key[pygame.K_LEFT] == False and key[pygame.K_RIGHT] == False:
                self.counter = 0
                self.index = 0
                if self.direction == 1:
                    self.image = self.images_right[self.index]
                if self.direction == -1:
                    self.image = self.images_left[self.index]
```
To control the animation of the character, a class named Player was created. In it, an arrangement of images is loaded that in this case will provide the effect that it walks when the directional keys are pressed from the keyboard.
```
class Player():
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.reset_game(x, y)
```
Code snippet that controls character animation
```
#Handling animation into the character
            if self.counter > walk_nice:
                self.counter = 0
                self.index += 1
            if self.index >= len(self.images_right):
                    self.index = 0
            if self.direction == 1:
                    self.image = self.images_right[self.index]
            if self.direction == -1:
                    self.image = self.images_left[self.index]
```
To put the elements that are part of the game in the player's window, a class called World was created. This class is in charge of containing everything that is displayed to the user.

```
class World():
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.tile_list = []
```
Part of some images that are loaded into the World class to be displayed in the main window of the video game.
```
#Loading images to be put it into the world
        dirt_img = pygame.image.load('img/dirt.png')
        dirt1_img = pygame.image.load('img/dirt1.png')
        dirt2_img = pygame.image.load('img/dirt2.png')
        ground_img = pygame.image.load('img/ground0.png')
        ground1_img = pygame.image.load('img/ground1.png')
....
```
These images were placed using a grid as a reference. For this, use was made of **tile** and **Sprite** which can be used within **Pygame**. Each image is randomly assigned an integer number that must be within an array-type list that basically represents the position of the image that we want to place within our window for the game.
```
                 if tile == 4:
                    spike = Enemy(col_count * tile_size, row_count * tile_size - 15)
                    spike_group.add(spike)
                if tile == 100:
                    spike_invert = Enemy_invert(col_count * tile_size, row_count * tile_size - 15)
                    spike_invert_group.add(spike_invert)
                if tile == 101:
                    spike_invert_y = Enemy_invert_y(col_count * tile_size, row_count * tile_size -15, 0, 1)
                    spike_invert_y_group.add(spike_invert_y)
                if tile == 102:
                    spike_invert_y_opposite = Enemy_invert_y_opposite(col_count * tile_size, row_count * tile_size - 15, 0, 1)
                    spike_invert_y_opposite_group.add(spike_invert_y_opposite)
```
The class that contains the numbers that represent the grid is named **world_data** and contains the following information
```

If the character suffers a collision with some enemy element located in the player's window, then a button appears with the possibility of restarting the game. The function that controls this part is the following
```
def reset_game(self, x, y):
        self.images_right = []
        self.images_left = []
        self.index = 0
        self.counter = 0
        for num in range(1, 24):            
            img_RIGHT = pygame.image.load(f'img/hero/hero{num}.png')
            img_RIGHT = pygame.transform.scale(img_RIGHT, (60, 90))
            img_LEFT = pygame.transform.flip(img_RIGHT, True, False)
            self.images_right.append(img_RIGHT)
            self.images_left.append(img_LEFT)
           
        self.image = self.images_right[self.index]
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.x = x
        self.rect.y = y
        self.width = self.image.get_width()
        self.height = self.image.get_height()    
        self.vel_y = 0
        self.jumped = False
        self.direction = 0
```
This is the code fragment that validates when the character had a collision with an enemy within the game area. A message appears to the user plus an image of the character that he represents who died and a button to restart the game also appears.
```
#Checking for collision with the enemies in the game
            if pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self, spike_group, False):
                game_over = -1
            #Play sound when the player died
                game_over_fx.play()

            if pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self, spike_invert_y_group, False):
                game_over = -1
            #Play sound when the player died
                game_over_fx.play()

            if pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self, spike_invert_group, False):      
                game_over = -1
            #Play sound when the player died
                game_over_fx.play()

            #Checking for collision with the fire
            if pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self, dang_group, False):
                game_over = -1
            #Play sound when the player died
                game_over_fx.play() 
                

            #For update the player coordinates
            self.rect.x += dx
            self.rect.y += dy
        
        elif game_over == -1:
        
            for num in range(1, 15):
                self.dead_image = pygame.image.load(f'img/hero_death/hero_death{num}.png')
                #dead_image = pygame.transform.scale(dead_image, (60, 90))
                self.image = self.dead_image
                

            draw_text('You cant beat the Pygame Challenge. Try again..!', font, blue, (screen_width // 2) - 700, screen_height // 2 )
           

            if self.rect.y > 50:
                    self.rect.y -= 1
        

        #Draw the player onto images
        screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)
        #pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 255, 255), self.rect, 1)
         
        return game_over
```
This is a code snippet that allows us to work with the **Sprite** type classes provided by **Pygame** to add elements to the game window. Here we present some **sprite groups** that were created
```
spike_group = pygame.sprite.Group()
spike_invert_group = pygame.sprite.Group()
spike_invert_y_group = pygame.sprite.Group()
spike_invert_y_opposite_group = pygame.sprite.Group()
dang_group = pygame.sprite.Group()
coin_group = pygame.sprite.Group()
```

Then those **Sprite groups** should be drawn in the window. This is a code snippet that performs that action.
```
        spike_group.draw(screen)
        spike_invert_group.draw(screen)
        spike_invert_y_group.draw(screen)
        spike_invert_y_opposite_group.draw(screen)
        dang_group.draw(screen)
        coin_group.draw(screen)
        world.draw()
```
A button named "Credits" was put in the upper right corner. As its name implies, it displays the name of the person who created the game. When the user presses the button by clicking on it, a message appears with the name of the developer. In this case, the name of Danny Chavez appears. This message lasts for 3 seconds on the screen and then fades away to give the player the chance to continue the game. The code snippet that does this is as follows:

```
# create the credit button rectangle
        credit_button_width = 100
        credit_button_height = 50
        credit_button = pygame.Rect(screen_width - credit_button_width - 10, 10, credit_button_width, credit_button_height)

    # set up the font for displaying the message
        font = pygame.font.SysFont('Arial', 30)

    # draw the credit button
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0, 255, 0), credit_button)
        credit_message = font.render('Credits', True, (255, 255, 255))
        credit_message_rect = credit_message.get_rect(center=credit_button.center)
        screen.blit(credit_message, credit_message_rect)    
    
    # check for mouse clicks on the credit button
    mouse_pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
    mouse_clicked = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()
    if credit_button.collidepoint(mouse_pos) and mouse_clicked[0]:
        # display the credit message
        message1 = font.render('This game was created by Danny Chavez', True, (0, 0, 0))
        message2 = font.render('using Pygame.', True, (0, 0, 0))
        message1_rect = message1.get_rect(center=(screen_width/2, screen_height/2-20))
        message2_rect = message2.get_rect(center=(screen_width/2, screen_height/2+20))
        screen.blit(message1, message1_rect)
        screen.blit(message2, message2_rect)
        pygame.display.update()
        pygame.time.wait(3000) # wait for 3 seconds before clearing the message
        screen.fill((0, 0, 0)) # clear the screen
    
    # draw the credit button again (in case it was covered by the credit message)
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (95, 150, 179), credit_button)
    screen.blit(credit_message, credit_message_rect)
```
And finally the game loop part looks as follows
```
run = True

while run:

    clock.tick(FPS)
    
    screen.blit(bg_img, (0, 0))

    if main_menu == True:
        if exit_button.draw():
            run = False
        if start_button.draw():
            main_menu = False
    else:
    
        if game_over == 0:
            spike_group.update()
            spike_invert_group.update()
            spike_invert_y_group.update()
            #Update the score of the player
            #Checking if a coin has been collected
            if pygame.sprite.spritecollide(player, coin_group, True):
                score += 1
                coin_fx.play()
            
            draw_text(' ' + str(score), font_score, white, tile_size - 10, 10)
        
        spike_group.draw(screen)
        spike_invert_group.draw(screen)
        spike_invert_y_group.draw(screen)
        spike_invert_y_opposite_group.draw(screen)
        dang_group.draw(screen)
        coin_group.draw(screen)
